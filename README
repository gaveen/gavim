gavim - A bunch of Vim configuration files
==========================================

Vim is by far one of the most powerful text editors around. And this
distribution of Vim files named "gavim" contains some tweaks & tricks
I use with Vim. Therefore if you are new to Vim, please take a little
time to learn proper Vim use before using a distribution like this.

I've tried to strike a balance between convenient power use of Vim
and preserving the Vim way of text editing. Hopefully, I'm not
impairing the Vim-fu of those few who have started using 'gavim'. :)

I have been using this on a host of different Linux distributions
without trouble. So it should work fine on a decent Linux system.
Let me know if you think of any improvements.


How to use (without Git)
------------------------
1. Download the latest file from:
    https://dl.dropbox.com/u/435850/gavim.tar.xz
    Eg: $ wget -c https://dl.dropbox.com/u/435850/gavim.tar.xz
2. Extract the downloaded XZ compressed tar file: gavim.tar.xz
    Eg: $ tar xJvf gavim.tar.xz
3. Rename the extracted 'gavim-xxxxxxxx' to 'gavim'
    Eg: $ mv gavim-xxxxxxxx gavim
4. Then you can place "gavim" somewhere and link .vim & .vimrc
    Eg: $ mv gavim ~/Apps/
        $ ln -s ~/Apps/gavim/.vim ~/.vim
        $ ln -s ~/Apps/gavim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
  Or,
  copy the contents of gavim (i.e.: .vim & .vimrc) to your home
  directory. But I recommend you use the above method instead.
    Eg: $ cp -r gavim/* ~/


How to use (with Git)
---------------------
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/gaveen/gavim.git
2. In the cloned directory run:
   $ git submodule update --init
3. Delete conflicting snippets by running:
   $ rm -rf ./.vim/bundle/plugin-snipmate/snippets
4. Link (Eg: using ln -s) the following files:
  I)  .vim/ as ~/.vim
  II) .vimrc as ~/.vimrc


How to update (with Git)
------------------------
1. In the cloned directory run:
   $ git pull && git submodule update


Tricks
------
Here are some of the significan tweaks I've made. Please read the
comments in the .vimrc file to understand how these were done.

  - Map Leader Key to:                                ","
      Easier to reach from home row
  - Function Key shortcuts
      Esc:                                            <F1>
      Toggles indentation when pasting:               <F2>
      Toggles auto-completing matching pairs:         <F3>
      Toggles spell checking (default lang: en_US):   <F4>
      Applies main color scheme:                      <F5>
      Applies alternative color scheme:               <F6>
      Go to previous buffer:                          <F7>
      Go to next buffer:                              <F8>
  - Sortcuts with system clipbard when supported
      Copy:                                           <leader>y
      Cut:                                            <leader>x
      Paste:                                          <leader>p
  - Write to a file with 'sudo' privileges:           :w!!
  - Toggle commenting the selection                   <leader>c<space>
  - Clear highlighting searched patterns:             <leader><space>
  - See and manage all open buffers:                  <leader>bb
  - Compare the changes since the last save (write):  <leader>?
  - Toggle directory tree pane:                       <leader>d
  - Toggle temporary read-only buffer:                <leader>s
  - Terminal withing Vim:                             <leader>t
      Works like your shell. Exit like a buffer with  :q
  - Auto-complete based on words & syntax awareness:  <ctrl>n
  - Toggle code folds based on syntax:                za
  - See spelling suggestion for incorrect words:      z=
  - Automatic completion of matching pairs
      Eg: (), [], {}, '', "", etc.
  - Show open buffers and active one in the status line
  - Default to use 2 spaces instead of tab
      Exceptions configured for: go, python, shell
  - Show non printable characters such as: tab, trailing spaces
  - A load of colorschemes to choose from (both dark and light)
      Too much actually. Will trim the number in future.

Also, please note some of these are in-built Vim features and some
comes from plugins. Therefore please refer the relevent documentation
to find additional shortcuts & configuration options.


Plugins
-------
I have included a set of plugins I find useful. Please find these
inside the .vim/bundle/ directory with names starting with "plugin-".
As for the current list, they are:
      ack, auto-pairs, bufexplorer, buftabs, conque, csapprox, ctrlp,
      fugitive, gitv, go, guicolorscheme, matchit, nerdcommenter,
      nerdtree, pandoc, puppet, rails, ruby-refactoring, scratch,
      snipmate, surround, vcscommand

Additionally I'm using Pathogen with Git submodules to manage Vim
plugins.


Dependencies
------------
Having the following ready in your system should ensure a smooth
experience. Lack of them would *not* break vim though. You can
pick what you want to use.

  # vim and/or gvim - at least try to use version 7.2 or above.
    Package: Fedora family => vim-enhanced / vim-X11,
             Debian family => vim (not default) / vim-gnome
  # git - to clone and update this repository and submodules
    Package: Fedora family => git, Debian family => git-core
  # ack - a better grep alternative if you plan to use :Ack
    Package: Fedora family => ack, Debian family => ack-grep
      if you use a Debian family OS, uncomment necessary line in vimrc
  # python - if you plan to use the Conque Terminal i.e., <leader>t
    Package: Fedora family => python, Debian family => python
  # vim-latex - Vim LaTeX Suite plugin to use vim as a LaTeX/TeX IDE
    Package: Fedora family => vim-latex, Debian => vim-latexsuite


Credit should go to everyone who brought you vim, plugins, related
tools, documentation, provide help and more. Also a big thank you to
official vim docs, Vim Tips Wiki and #vim channel on Freenode.

NOTE: uncomment line "let g:csa_Capable = 1" to explicitly say that
your vim is CSApprox capable even if :echo has('gui') returns 0.
